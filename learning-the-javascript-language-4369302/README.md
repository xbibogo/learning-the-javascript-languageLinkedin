JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, used to create dynamic websites along with a host of other applications. And like any language—whether spoken language or programming language—it takes time and practice to become conversant. In this course, Joe Chellman teaches you how to “speak” JavaScript by familiarizing yourself with the most commonly encountered topics and concepts. Joe starts out with some basic JavaScript syntax and jargon, then covers what you need to know about in the JavaScript toolbox, including variables, types, objects, arrays, operators, control structures, loops, and functions. Join Joe in this course to start your path toward JavaScript fluency and unlock the power of this popular language.
